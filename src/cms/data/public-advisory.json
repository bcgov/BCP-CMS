To help prevent WNS from taking hold in B.C., the Province is making investments in bat conservation projects.</p> <p><strong>To ensure the protection of bats and their habitat in this park, BC Parks strongly advises that personal caving gear that has been used anywhere east of the Rockies not be used in B.C. Also, before entering caves in B.C, cavers and visitors should consult the provincial WNS website, which includes a link to a Decontamination Protocol for Mines and Caves.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/wildlife/wildlife-health/wildlife-diseases/white-nose-syndrome\">Learn more about white-nose syndrome</a></p>",

To help prevent WNS from taking hold in B.C., the Province is making investments in bat conservation projects. <p><strong> To ensure the protection of bats and their habitat in this park, BC Parks strongly advises that personal caving gear that has been used anywhere east of the Rockies not be used in B.C. Also, before entering caves in B.C, cavers and visitors should consult the provincial WNS website, which includes a link to a Decontamination Protocol for Mines and Caves. </strong></p> <ul><li><a href=\"http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/wildlife/wildlife-health/wildlife-diseases/white-nose-syndrome\">Learn more about white-nose syndrome</a></li></ul>",

Trail/route surface is a good hard surface from Buchanan Creek to Kakwa Lake.</p>",
