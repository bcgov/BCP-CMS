## PROJECT STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

### Features
The application includes:
* Decoupling of content and its presentation.  
* Headless CMS using Strapi
* React front-end communicating with back-end Strapi API.  
* The API retrieves the content from the postgresql database and returns it to the presentation layer.
* NGINX acts as a reverse-proxy for all web applications.


### Technology Selection
* We hosted the application on OpenShift.  We built the application to be cloud-ready and able to work with a wide range of platforms and clouds.
* The Headless CMS loads in content/resources for the different sections of the application.
* NGINX was selected as a lightweight server and reverse proxy to handle routing and security.
